CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.2
    
    2019/01/01  Cosmetic changes and a minor change to 
        make the par-files as close as possible from 
        those generated with MACRO In FOCUS when 
        parametrising a metabolite (in layered output, 
        change that in principle does not affect the simulation 
        output).
    
    2019/01/07  Correct the correction of DEGMIC and DEGMAC 
        output in the par-file
    
    2019/01/10  Small bug fix with keep0conc for biennial 
        and triennial application intervals, no consequences 
        on results.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.1
    
    2018/12/26 In rmacroliteApplications(), when modifying CONCI, 
        a leading space was accidentally left in the case of 
        multiple applications per year with different application 
        rates. Now fixed.
        
    rmacroliteDegradation(), the degradation 
        rate is now rounded to a number of significant figures 
        rather than a number of significant digits after 
        the decimal mark. The same rounding is adopted for 
        parent and metabolites.
        
    rmacroliteInfo() was accidentally leaving information 
        on the old application pattern in the INFORMATION 
        section. Fixed.
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.0
    
    2018/12/08  Created a git repository for the package.
        First working version of the package
    
    2017/09/15  Start to prepare a package
        The code is based on the code of the R package 
        `rmacro` develloped during the research project 
        "PERFORM", managed by INRA. `rmacro` was develloped 
        by Julien Moeys while at SLU/CKB.
