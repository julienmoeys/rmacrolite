CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.1
    
    2018/12/26 In rmacroliteApplications(), when modifying CONCI, 
        a leading space was accidentally left in the case of 
        multiple applications per year with different application 
        rates. Now fixed.
    
    2018/12/26 In rmacroliteDegradation(), the degradation 
        rate is now rounded to a number of significant figures 
        rather than a number of significant digits after 
        the decimal mark. The same rounding is adopted for 
        parent and metabolites.
