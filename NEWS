CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.7
    
    2019/04/11  Fix a bug in rmacroliteInfo() that caused
        problems when working with MACRO 5.2 par-files
        (not INFORMATION section)
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.6
    
    2019/03/22  rmacroliteInfo() can now also change the 
        scenario name.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.5
    
    2019/02/18  rmacroliteApplications() now has an argument 
        'focus_mode' that can be set to 'gw' to set the 
        all the irrigation parameters like MACRO In FOCUS, 
        and skip using a par-file with the right number of 
        years interval between applications and the right 
        number of applications per year. rmacroliteApplications() 
        accounts for that automatically.
    
    2019/03/01  rmacroliteInfo() now also adjusts the start 
        end simulation date as well as the substance application
        frequency.
    
    2019/03/01  rmacroliteInfo() now also adjusts the 
        number of applications (on an application-year).
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.4
    
    2019/02/13  Renamed an example par-file that possibly 
        made Pandoc vignettes to crash because of a too 
        long file name in R examples
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.3
    
    2019/01/19 Fix bug in `rmacroliteInfo<-.macroParFile`
        causing a crash when using several applications 
        per year and metabolites
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.2
    
    2019/01/01  Cosmetic changes and a minor change to 
        make the par-files as close as possible from 
        those generated with MACRO In FOCUS when 
        parametrising a metabolite (in layered output, 
        change that in principle does not affect the simulation 
        output).
    
    2019/01/07  Correct the correction of DEGMIC and DEGMAC 
        output in the par-file
    
    2019/01/10  Small bug fix with keep0conc for biennial 
        and triennial application intervals, no consequences 
        on results.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.1
    
    2018/12/26 In rmacroliteApplications(), when modifying CONCI, 
        a leading space was accidentally left in the case of 
        multiple applications per year with different application 
        rates. Now fixed.
        
    rmacroliteDegradation(), the degradation 
        rate is now rounded to a number of significant figures 
        rather than a number of significant digits after 
        the decimal mark. The same rounding is adopted for 
        parent and metabolites.
        
    rmacroliteInfo() was accidentally leaving information 
        on the old application pattern in the INFORMATION 
        section. Fixed.
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.0
    
    2018/12/08  Created a git repository for the package.
        First working version of the package
    
    2017/09/15  Start to prepare a package
        The code is based on the code of the R package 
        `rmacro` develloped during the research project 
        "PERFORM", managed by INRA. `rmacro` was develloped 
        by Julien Moeys while at SLU/CKB.
