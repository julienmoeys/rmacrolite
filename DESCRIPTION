Title: R interface for the pesticide fate models MACRO In FOCUS and MACRO
Description: R interface for the pesticide fate models MACRO In FOCUS and MACRO. Import, modify, run and export MACRO In FOCUS or MACRO simulations, as .par-files (parameter files), from a template simulation-setup. Provides higher level functions to modify the substance properties and substance application patterns. The package is derived from the package `rmacro`, developed during the R&D project PERFORM (2013-2016; Funding: "Pour et Sur le Plan Ecophyto" (PSPE)). Compared to `rmacro`, the package has been significantly refactored, and there is no backward compatibility.
